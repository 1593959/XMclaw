    """Walk a tool-provider tree, return ``(skill_tool_provider, registry)``.

    B-298: the factory wraps tools as
    ``CompositeToolProvider(CompositeToolProvider(SkillTool, ...),
    MemoryBridge)``, so the SkillToolProvider can sit two levels
    deep. Pre-B-298 single-level lookup against the wrong attribute
    name (``_providers``) silently returned ``(None, None)``,
    leaving:

    * the EvolutionAgent without a registry → B-296's per-skill
      HEAD inference (``registry.active_version(skill_id)``)
      degraded to ``head_version=None`` for every skill;
    * the VariantSelector's ``enabled`` branch never taken →
      candidates never got explore-traffic → controller's
      ``min_plays`` threshold never cleared → B-294's evaluate()
      trigger fired but always proposed nothing.

    Returns the first node in a depth-first traversal whose
    ``_registry`` attribute looks like a SkillRegistry (has the
    ``list_skill_ids`` method). ``(None, None)`` when no such
    provider exists in the tree (e.g. echo-mode daemon, or an
    agent assembled with only BuiltinTools).

    The walker tries public attribute names first
    (``children``) then private ones (``_children``) so a
    custom ToolProvider that exposes a public children API
    can override the walk without subclassing
    CompositeToolProvider.
